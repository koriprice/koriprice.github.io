# Welcome to my Professional Development website! 
## This is where I will be posing weekly updates and reflections on my project for the semester.

### Week 2 Update
This week, I've been working on finalizing my project. I would like to take advantage of the LinkedIn training courses offered through CU to improve some of my soft skills. I've been exploring the courses offered in order to pick which ones I would like to do and make a schedule for myself for the rest of the semester. Right now, I have several group projects, so I know that I definitely want to do some courses on teamwork and communication. I could always improve on time management, so I've been looking into relevant courses for that as well.

So far, one of the main challenges that I've had is that there are so many courses to choose from, and many of them are only a few minutes long. Finding courses that are substantial enough to make up a semester-long project is more difficult than I originally thought. To improve my process this upcomming week, I think my searches for courses could be more specific and directed, and hopefully it will be easier to find what I'm looking for.

Next week, I'm planning on finalizing my course selections so that I have a clearer idea of the rest of my semester, and I can get started on my project proposal.

### Week 3 Update
Last week, I finalized what training courses I want to complete for my project and saved them all on LinkedIn. I also made a schedule for the rest of the semester so that I have a plan for what courses I am doing each week. 

This week, I am going to be starting with the LinkedIn training. The first skill that I am going to be focusing on is teamwork, and I will be completing the "Teamwork Foundations" training course. 

As of right now, I do not see an impediments in my way. If anything, getting too busy with my other courses/work would be the only issue, but I believe that my workload for this week should allow me to complete everything. To make sure of this, I'm planning on doing the LinkedIn training early in the week before other deadlines come up to make sure that it doesn't get pushed aside. 

To improve my process, I think that I could focus on not procrastinating. It is easy to leave the LinkedIn training until the last minute, because I know that I will be able to complete it. However, I do not think this is the most useful way to do the training. If I get a head start on it, I will be able to spend more time and get more out of it, as well as be less stressed about the deadline. 

### Week 4 Update
Last week, I started with my LinkedIn training. I completed the first course on my schedule, Teamwork Foundations, as well as completed all of the chapter quizzes and the final exam. In general, I think that I learned a lot from this course. I have definitely started thinking about teamwork and my role as a team member in a different way. I am excited to keep delving into teamwork in the next couple of weeks and see how I can apply what I have already learned to the team projects that I am currently working on.

Next week, I am going to be starting on the Improve your Teamwork course, and my goal is to finish the first half.

The main obstacle that I am worried about is time. This is a longer course, and the first half will take roughly 3.5 hours, not including any of the quizzes along the way.

To improve my process and help mitigate the time issue this week, I think that I could still be better about starting the training earlier in the week. That way, I can give myself more time and don't feel like I have to rush through everything at the last minute. Also, because this is a longer training course, I think that starting earlier would allow me to break it up into multiple sections. I think this would make it more manageable and improve my process.
