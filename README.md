# Welcome to my Professional Development website! 
## This is where I will be posing weekly updates and reflections on my project for the semester.

### Week 2 Update
This week, I've been working on finalizing my project. I would like to take advantage of the LinkedIn training courses offered through CU to improve some of my soft skills. I've been exploring the courses offered in order to pick which ones I would like to do and make a schedule for myself for the rest of the semester. Right now, I have several group projects, so I know that I definitely want to do some courses on teamwork and communication. I could always improve on time management, so I've been looking into relevant courses for that as well.

So far, one of the main challenges that I've had is that there are so many courses to choose from, and many of them are only a few minutes long. Finding courses that are substantial enough to make up a semester-long project is more difficult than I originally thought. To improve my process this upcomming week, I think my searches for courses could be more specific and directed, and hopefully it will be easier to find what I'm looking for.

Next week, I'm planning on finalizing my course selections so that I have a clearer idea of the rest of my semester, and I can get started on my project proposal.

### Week 3 Update
Last week, I finalized what training courses I want to complete for my project and saved them all on LinkedIn. I also made a schedule for the rest of the semester so that I have a plan for what courses I am doing each week. 

This week, I am going to be starting with the LinkedIn training. The first skill that I am going to be focusing on is teamwork, and I will be completing the "Teamwork Foundations" training course. 

As of right now, I do not see an impediments in my way. If anything, getting too busy with my other courses/work would be the only issue, but I believe that my workload for this week should allow me to complete everything. To make sure of this, I'm planning on doing the LinkedIn training early in the week before other deadlines come up to make sure that it doesn't get pushed aside. 

To improve my process, I think that I could focus on not procrastinating. It is easy to leave the LinkedIn training until the last minute, because I know that I will be able to complete it. However, I do not think this is the most useful way to do the training. If I get a head start on it, I will be able to spend more time and get more out of it, as well as be less stressed about the deadline. 

### Week 4 Update
Last week, I started with my LinkedIn training. I completed the first course on my schedule, Teamwork Foundations, as well as completed all of the chapter quizzes and the final exam. In general, I think that I learned a lot from this course. I have definitely started thinking about teamwork and my role as a team member in a different way. I am excited to keep delving into teamwork in the next couple of weeks and see how I can apply what I have already learned to the team projects that I am currently working on.

Next week, I am going to be starting on the Improve your Teamwork course, and my goal is to finish the first half.

The main obstacle that I am worried about is time. This is a longer course, and the first half will take roughly 3.5 hours, not including any of the quizzes along the way.

To improve my process and help mitigate the time issue this week, I think that I could still be better about starting the training earlier in the week. That way, I can give myself more time and don't feel like I have to rush through everything at the last minute. Also, because this is a longer training course, I think that starting earlier would allow me to break it up into multiple sections. I think this would make it more manageable and improve my process. 

### Week 5 Update
Last week I got started on the Improve Your Teamwork course on LinkedIn. This course was a little different from the other ones that I have planned for the semester, as it is actually a "Learning Path." This means that it is broken down into different courses that all cover topics related to teamwork. Of the 8 courses included, I completed the first 4 along with the chapter quizzes and exams.

Next week, I am going to be completing the remaining 4 courses in this learning path. 

The next four courses are a little longer than the first four courses, so I think that time will be my biggest challenge. Also, because each course is a different topic, it is a little more difficult to fully digest the course and what I have learned before moving onto the next one if I am doing them back to back. Because of this, I am slightly worried that I will not be getting as much out of the courses as I can.

To improve my strategy, I think that I need to break up my scheduled time for working on the courses in the learning path. The last couple of weeks, I have set aside dedicated time to work on this project, but it has been all at once. With this learning path specifically, I think focusing on one subtopic and then taking some time away to process and let it sink in before diving into the next subtopic will improve my overall understanding of the learning path. 

### Week 6 Update
Last week, I completed the second half of the Improve Your Teamwork Skills Learning Path. The courses and specific topics that I covered were Working on a Cross-Functional Team, Communicating with Diplomacy and Tact, Interpersonal Skills for Inclusive Workplaces, and Building Business Relationships. Along the way, I completed all of the chapter quizzes, but I have not done the exams for these courses yet. After considering Dr. Knox's comment last week, I think that it would be an interesting experiment to wait to take the exams to see how much information I am retaining over a longer period of time. 

Next week, I am moving on from teamwork and starting with communication. For communication, I am also going to be following a Learning Path, and I am planning on completing the first half next week. The topics in this half include Communicating with Confidence, Building Trust, and Igniting Emotional Engagement. In addition to completing these three courses, I plan on taking the exams from the courses that I completed this week. I am excited to be moving on to another topic, and I think that the change of pace will help me stay motivated and focused for the upcoming weeks!

I think the biggest obstacle will be taking the exams. For all of the previous exams, I have taken them directly after I completed the course, and I am not sure how waiting will affect my score. As outlined in my project proposal, I would ideally achieve a passing grade of 70% or higher on all exams, so hopefully I will still be able to accomplish this. 

To improve my process, especially with the new exam format that I am trying, I think it would be beneficial to take more detailed notes while working through the courses. This way, I can refer back to them at any time, not just to study for an exam, but to have as a reference whenever I might want to apply some of the concepts to projects that I am currently working on. I did find it a little monotonous over the last three weeks to only be learning about teamwork, so switching up my proposed schedule might improve my process as well. Looking ahead, I have weeks 9, 10, and 11 all dedicated to Leadership, but changing this and breaking up the Leadership courses might keep me more engaged and improve my process.

### Week 7 Update
Last week, I started delving into communication. I completed 3 of the 6 courses in the communication skills learning path that I've chosen to work through. The topics included communicating with confidence, building trust, and igniting emotional engagement. Overall, I thought they provided a good foundation for communication, and I especially enjoyed the communicating with confidence course. The speaker gave a lot of great tips that I feel like I can easily adopt, like slowing down when you're speaking and taking pauses in between sentences. During this course, I also realized that I tend to use a lot of conjugations when I present something or speak in meetings, and this course demonstrated that doing this makes you appear less confident. It also is not the best way to communicate, as you never get to finish one thought or point before you move onto the next one. I did not realize how much I do this until working through this course, so it is definitely something that I will be working to change. I also took the exams for the courses Communicating with Diplomacy and Tact and Building Business Relationships. I had completed both of these courses as part of last week's work. I passed both exams and did not see a significant difference in my scores compared to the exams that I took immediately after finishing the courses. 

Next week, I am planning on completing the final 3 courses in the communication learning path. These are Learning to be Approachable, Communicating Nonverbally, and Communication Foundations. I will also be working on my project update report.

The biggest issue that I will be facing next week is time. Due to an unforeseen family circumstance, I will be unavailable for most of the week. However, because I was able to get this week's work done a few days ahead of schedule, I am optimistic that I can use the extra time to get a head start on next week's work to ensure that I complete it on time.  

To improve my process, I think that I could continue to experiment with the timing of the exams. While taking them a few days after I completed the courses did not seem to have much of an impact on my scores, it would be interesting to see if this changes after a few weeks. For the courses that I completed this week, I believe that it will be beneficial to wait for 2 weeks before taking the exams. This way, I will have a better understanding of how much information I am retaining over a longer period of time.

### Week 9 Update
This week, I completed the Leadership in Tech course on LinkedIn. This course was much different than I anticipated, but I still think that it was valuable. The other courses that I have completed have all been broken down into smaller sections and topics, but this one did not follow that format. Instead, the course consisted of short interviews with different leaders at LinkedIn. It was less structured, but I did enjoy getting to hear a lot of different perspectives on what leadership is and what makes a good leader. It was interesting to see how diverse leadership approaches can be, even within the same company. This week, I also completed the exams for Communicating with Confidence and Igniting Emotional Engagement, which I completed two weeks ago. I was able to pass both exams with a score of at least 80%.

Next week, I am going to be taking the exams for the Learning to be Approachable and Communication Foundations courses. I am also going to be doing the Leadership: Practical Skills course. 

I think my biggest obstacle may be my revised goal of 80% on all of the exams. While I was able to meet this goal this week, the exams definitely felt harder than when I took them immediately, and I was much closer to not meeting my goal than I had been in the past.

To improve my process, I should dedicate more time to studying previous courses. I have mostly been focused on whatever course I am currently working through, but the increased difficulty I had with the exams makes me think that I should spend more time reviewing my notes after I have completed a course. If I spend more time looking over the previous content, I think I will be able to perform better on the exams and retain more of the information once I am done with this project.
