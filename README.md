# Welcome to my Professional Development website! 
## This is where I will be posing weekly updates and reflections on my project for the semester.

### Week 2 Update
This week, I've been working on finalizing my project. I would like to take advantage of the LinkedIn training courses offered through CU to improve some of my soft skills. I've been exploring the courses offered in order to pick which ones I would like to do and make a schedule for myself for the rest of the semester. Right now, I have several group projects, so I know that I definitely want to do some courses on teamwork and communication. I could always improve on time management, so I've been looking into relevant courses for that as well.

So far, one of the main challenges that I've had is that there are so many courses to choose from, and many of them are only a few minutes long. Finding courses that are substantial enough to make up a semester-long project is more difficult than I originally thought. To improve my process this upcomming week, I think my searches for courses could be more specific and directed, and hopefully it will be easier to find what I'm looking for.

Next week, I'm planning on finalizing my course selections so that I have a clearer idea of the rest of my semester, and I can get started on my project proposal.

### Week 3 Update
Last week, I finalized what training courses I want to complete for my project and saved them all on LinkedIn. I also made a schedule for the rest of the semester so that I have a plan for what courses I am doing each week. 

This week, I am going to be starting with the LinkedIn training. The first skill that I am going to be focusing on is teamwork, and I will be completing the "Teamwork Foundations" training course. 

As of right now, I do not see an impediments in my way. If anything, getting too busy with my other courses/work would be the only issue, but I believe that my workload for this week should allow me to complete everything. To make sure of this, I'm planning on doing the LinkedIn training early in the week before other deadlines come up to make sure that it doesn't get pushed aside. 

To improve my process, I think that I could focus on not procrastinating. It is easy to leave the LinkedIn training until the last minute, because I know that I will be able to complete it. However, I do not think this is the most useful way to do the training. If I get a head start on it, I will be able to spend more time and get more out of it, as well as be less stressed about the deadline. 

### Week 4 Update
Last week, I started with my LinkedIn training. I completed the first course on my schedule, Teamwork Foundations, as well as completed all of the chapter quizzes and the final exam. In general, I think that I learned a lot from this course. I have definitely started thinking about teamwork and my role as a team member in a different way. I am excited to keep delving into teamwork in the next couple of weeks and see how I can apply what I have already learned to the team projects that I am currently working on.

Next week, I am going to be starting on the Improve your Teamwork course, and my goal is to finish the first half.

The main obstacle that I am worried about is time. This is a longer course, and the first half will take roughly 3.5 hours, not including any of the quizzes along the way.

To improve my process and help mitigate the time issue this week, I think that I could still be better about starting the training earlier in the week. That way, I can give myself more time and don't feel like I have to rush through everything at the last minute. Also, because this is a longer training course, I think that starting earlier would allow me to break it up into multiple sections. I think this would make it more manageable and improve my process. 

### Week 5 Update
Last week I got started on the Improve Your Teamwork course on LinkedIn. This course was a little different from the other ones that I have planned for the semester, as it is actually a "Learning Path." This means that it is broken down into different courses that all cover topics related to teamwork. Of the 8 courses included, I completed the first 4 along with the chapter quizzes and exams.

Next week, I am going to be completing the remaining 4 courses in this learning path. 

The next four courses are a little longer than the first four courses, so I think that time will be my biggest challenge. Also, because each course is a different topic, it is a little more difficult to fully digest the course and what I have learned before moving onto the next one if I am doing them back to back. Because of this, I am slightly worried that I will not be getting as much out of the courses as I can.

To improve my strategy, I think that I need to break up my scheduled time for working on the courses in the learning path. The last couple of weeks, I have set aside dedicated time to work on this project, but it has been all at once. With this learning path specifically, I think focusing on one subtopic and then taking some time away to process and let it sink in before diving into the next subtopic will improve my overall understanding of the learning path. 

### Week 6 Update
Last week, I completed the second half of the Improve Your Teamwork Skills Learning Path. The courses and specific topics that I covered were Working on a Cross-Functional Team, Communicating with Diplomacy and Tact, Interpersonal Skills for Inclusive Workplaces, and Building Business Relationships. Along the way, I completed all of the chapter quizzes, but I have not done the exams for these courses yet. After considering Dr. Knox's comment last week, I think that it would be an interesting experiment to wait to take the exams to see how much information I am retaining over a longer period of time. 

Next week, I am moving on from teamwork and starting with communication. For communication, I am also going to be following a Learning Path, and I am planning on completing the first half next week. The topics in this half include Communicating with Confidence, Building Trust, and Igniting Emotional Engagement. In addition to completing these three courses, I plan on taking the exams from the courses that I completed this week. I am excited to be moving on to another topic, and I think that the change of pace will help me stay motivated and focused for the upcoming weeks!

I think the biggest obstacle will be taking the exams. For all of the previous exams, I have taken them directly after I completed the course, and I am not sure how waiting will affect my score. As outlined in my project proposal, I would ideally achieve a passing grade of 70% or higher on all exams, so hopefully I will still be able to accomplish this. 

To improve my process, especially with the new exam format that I am trying, I think it would be beneficial to take more detailed notes while working through the courses. This way, I can refer back to them at any time, not just to study for an exam, but to have as a reference whenever I might want to apply some of the concepts to projects that I am currently working on. I did find it a little monotonous over the last three weeks to only be learning about teamwork, so switching up my proposed schedule might improve my process as well. Looking ahead, I have weeks 9, 10, and 11 all dedicated to Leadership, but changing this and breaking up the Leadership courses might keep me more engaged and improve my process.
